```bash
npm install @thoughtbot/eslint-config --save-dev

## Usage

Set your [ESLint configuration][eslint-configuration] to:

  "extends": "@thoughtbot/eslint-config"
}
```

You can override rules from the shared configuration, by setting your
own values within the `rules` property:

```json
{
  "extends": "@thoughtbot/eslint-config",
  "rules": {
    "quotes": [
      2,
      "double"
    ]
  }
}
```

You can also turn a rule off, by setting the value of the rule to `"off"`:

```json
{
  "extends": "@thoughtbot/eslint-config",
  "rules": {
    "quotes": "off"
  }
}
```
